# CMSC 408 - Spring 2025 - Homework 8

# World Bank Indicator Analysis

## Overview

This assignment focuses on exploring the World Bank country dataset by writing and running a bunch of SQL queries.
The goal is to strengthen our skills in relational querying, aggregation, filtering, and data transformation, while also practicing documentation using Quarto and Python helper functions.
We investigate basic statistics (like number of countries and regions), build more complex reports (like pivot tables and percentage breakdowns), and handle special tasks like updating missing values.
